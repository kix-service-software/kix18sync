# TO DO

- [ ] not in mapping given attributes cause warning
- [ ] in some cases DF Source uses identifier string instead of some value given by `"SET:someval"`
- [ ] check mandatory contact attributes (at least Firstname, Lastname, Email)
- [ ] for users PW policy might prevent creating a user - show message from failure HTTP response
