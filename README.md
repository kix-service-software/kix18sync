# kix18sync

To provide simple tools to import data into KIX18 by using its REST-API, data sources may be remote DB tables or CSV files.

These scripts are intented to work as external tools accessing KIX only by its REST-API. They can be run on the docker host running KIX, however this scenario is not a generic use case. Keep in mind to give proper configuration of the KIX-REST **Backend** API, that is correct port number if running on the docker host.

These scripts **do not** evaluate your docker setup in environment files in order to run.


## Contents/Structure
- directory `bin`: scripts for data synchronization
- directory `config`: default/sample configuration
- directory `sample`: sample import data (CSV)

## Required Perl Packages

Scripts have been developed using CentOS8 or Ubuntu/Debian as target plattform. Following packages must be installed:

- CentOS/RHEL
```
shell> sudo yum install perl-Config-Simple perl-REST-Client perl-JSON perl-LWP-Protocol-https perl-DBI perl-URI perl-Pod-Usage perl-Getopt-Long perl-Text-CSV
```
- Ubuntu/Debian
```
shell> sudo apt install libconfig-simple-perl librest-client-perl libjson-perl liblwp-protocol-https-perl libdbi-perl liburi-perl perl-doc libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl libtext-csv-perl
```

## Manage Roles and Permissions - kix18.ManageRoles.pl

Script `bin/kix18.ManageRoles.pl` retrieves role and permission infomation from a KIX18 by communicating with its REST-API.

The provided `RoleData_Sample.csv` contains default roles and permissions as delivered by KIX. We try to keep this up to date. However, this script collection is mostly a fun side project, so please bear with us if it should lag behind and give us a hind.


### Usage

```
./bin/kix18.ManageRoles.pl --help
./bin/kix18.ManageRoles.pl --config ./config/kix18.ManageRoles.cfg --dir export -d /tmp
./bin/kix18.ManageRoles.pl --config ./config/kix18.ManageRoles.cfg --dir import --f ./sample/RoleData_Sample.csv --verbose 2
```


The script can be used by referring to a configuration and object type only. Any parameter given by command line overwrites values specified in the config file. Use `kix18.DBSync.pl --help` for a detailed parameter listing.


- `dir`: direction (import|export), "export" if not given
- `config`: path to configuration file instead of command line params
- `url`: URL to KIX backend API (e.g. https://t12345-api.kix.cloud)
- `u`: KIX user login
- `p`: KIX user password
- `d`: output directory to which role permissions are written (if direction "export")
- `f`: input file (if direction "import")
- `verbose`: makes the script verbose (1..4)
- `help`: show help message

#### Resolving Team-/Queue-Names

The script is able to resolve team names given in permissions by `<TeamName2ID:Some::Full::Team::Name>` instead of numeric IDs. This is only supported in import. If a team name cannot be resolved the given pattern is replaced by `UnknownTeam_Some::Full::Team::Name`.


### Configuration

Required configuration may to be placed in a separate config file which is read upon script execution. A sample config might look like this:

```
# KIX18 params for information retrieval...
[KIXAPI]
KIXUserName        = "API-User"
KIXPassword        = "API-User-Password"
KIXURL             = http://localhost:20000
Proxy              = ""
APITimeOut         = 30

# CSV configuration ...
[CSV]
#Direction          = "export"
#CSVOutputDir       = "/tmp"
#CSVFile            = "/tmp/some.csv"
#CSVSeparator       = TAB
CSVSeparator       = ";"
CSVEncoding        = "utf-8"
CSVQuote           = "\""
```

## Sync from CSV-File - kix18.CSVSync.pl

Script `bin/kix18.CSVSync.pl` provides a client for importing data from CSV files to KIX18 REST-API, supporting
- Contact (including user)
- Organisation
- SLA

Users are created/updated if a data for `Login` is given. Only then further columns such as `Password`, `Roles`, `IsAgent` and `IsCustomer` are considered at all. If there is no user context (`IsAgent` or  `IsCustomer`) set, the users account will be set to `invalid`.  `Roles` must contain **comma-separated names of roles** existing in your KIX. Only roles which match the given usage context (`IsAgent` or  `IsCustomer`) are accepted. Predefined default roles `Agent User` or `Customer` are added automatically by the script depending on the users context (hopefully no one renamed them). Non-existing or misspelled **roles will not be created.**

Dynamic Field values are split along comma and submitted as arrays by default, see config file option `DFArrayCommaSplit`.

### Required Perl Packages

For handling CSV following packages need to be installed additionally:

- CentOS
```
shell> sudo yum install libtext-csv-perl
```
- Ubuntu/Debian
```
shell> sudo apt install perl-Text-CSV
```


### Usage
`./bin/kix18.CSVSync.pl --config ./config/kix18.CSVSync.cfg --ot Contact|Organisation|SLA|Asset|Queue`

The script can be used by referring to a configuration and object type only. Any parameter given by command line overwrites values specified in the config file. Use `kix18.CSVSync.pl --help` for a detailed parameter listing.

- `config`: path to configuration file instead of command line params
- `ot`: object to be imported (Contact|Organisation|SLA|Asset|Queue)
- `ac`: asset class name (required for asset import)
- `url`: URL to KIX backend API (e.g. https://t12345-api.kix.cloud)
- `u`: KIX user login
- `p`: KIX user password
- `verbose`: makes the script verbose (use `--verbose 4` for max. verbosity)
- `help`: show help message
- `i`: source directory from which CSV-files matching name patterns fpr object type are read
- `if`: source file for import (if given, option `i` is ignored)
- `o`: destination directory, where result summary is written
- `r`: if set, import files are deleted after processing
- `fpw`: if set, an updated user will get the password specified by the import data


Depending on the object type, any CSV files matching name pattern from the input directory are read. Files containing `Result` are omitted. For each import file a `SourceFileName.Result.csv` is written. Name patterns are ignored if a specific file name is given.

- object type `Asset`: name pattern `*Asset*.csv`
- object type `Contact`: name pattern `*Contact*.csv`
- object type `Organisation`: name pattern `*Org*.csv`
- object type `SLA`: name pattern `*SLA*.csv`
- object type `Queue`: name pattern `*Queue*.csv`


### Configuration

Most configuration has to be placed in a separate config file which is read upon script execution. A sample config might look like this:

### Asset Data Import

There is no need (or chance) to define a custom mapping of CSV-rows to asset-attributes. Therefore, this mapping must be included in CSV files itself by providing a corresponding header line (1st line). You may use exports created by KIX18 GUI asset export as sample or (recommended) just have a look at the provided examples in order to understand how it works. Keep in mind that your asset class definitions may vary from the default settings.

If an asset number is given the script will perform an update, only if the asset number can be found. It **will not** automatically create the asset if the given number is not available. The script **does not** preserve values of previous versions of the updated asset (...yet. it implements an "all-or-nothing-update-approach"). So far there is no default value option for deployment- nor incident-state available.

If no asset number is given, the script will create a new asset in the asset class defined by parameter `--ac`.

`./bin/kix18.CSVSync.pl --config ./config/kix18.CSVSync.cfg --ot Asset --if ./sample/AssetData04_Computer_Sample.csv --ac Computer`


### Queue vs. Teams?

KIX18 uses a more understandable wording for "queues" which are some sort of assignee groups to which tickets are assigned. A group of people working together to solve incidents, answer requests or plan changes. One could call these people "a team". However, due to historic reasons the original naming "queues" is still used in the API. Therefore and for us being a bit anachronistic, we stick to "queues" in this import script as well... ;-).


----
## Sync from Database Source - kix18.DBSync.pl

Script `bin/kix18.DBSync.pl` provides a client for importing data from a remote DB to KIX18 REST-API, supporting Contact and Organisation (so far).

Dynamic Field values are split along comma and submitted as arrays by default, see config file option `DFArrayCommaSplit`.

### Required Perl Packages

Depending on the DBMS to be connected, additional packages might be required, e.g.
- CentOS
```
shell> sudo yum install perl-DBD-Pg
shell> sudo yum install perl-DBD-MySQL
shell> sudo yum install perl-DBD-ODBC
```
- Ubuntu/Debian
```
shell> sudo apt install libdbd-pg-perl
shell> sudo apt install libdbd-mysql-perl
shell> sudo apt install libdbd-odbc-perl
```


### Usage
`./bin/kix18.DBSync.pl --config ./config/kix18.DBSync.cfg --ot Contact|Organisation`

The script can be used by referring to a configuration and object type only. Any parameter given by command line overwrites values specified in the config file. Use `kix18.DBSync.pl --help` for a detailed parameter listing.

- `config`: path to configuration file instead of command line params
- `ot`: object to be imported (Contact|Organisation)
- `url`: URL to KIX backend API (e.g. https://t12345-api.kix.cloud)
- `u`: KIX user login
- `p`: KIX user password
- `du`: DBUser  (if not given by config)
- `dp`: DBPassword (if not given by config)
- `verbose`: makes the script verbose (use `--verbose 4` for max. verbosity)
- `help`: show help message


### Configuration

The major configuration has to be placed in a separate config file which is read upon script execution. A sample config might look like this:

```
# KIXAPI configuration
[KIXAPI]
KIXUserName        = "API-User"
KIXPassword        = "API-User-Password"
KIXURL             = http://localhost:20000

DSN                = "DBI:Pg:dbname=kix17;host=kix.company.de;"
DBUser             = "SomeDBUser"
DBPassword         = "PASSWORD"
DFArrayCommaSplit  = "1"

# limit might be useful for testing (only for MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL)...
DBLimit     = "100"

# following sections define the mapping of DB-tables to KIX-API resources
# Table        = "some_customer_user_table"
# Condition is optional and allows to filter relevant DB entries
# Condition    = "WHERE login != ''"
# OtherRessourceAttribute = "DB column name"
# if an attribute is not given in the DB-table it may be set to a fixed value by
# SomeRessourceAttribute = "SET:<fixedvaluehere>"

# Mapping configuration for contact items...
[Contact]
Table        = "some_customer_user"
Condition    = ""
# use condition if you want to sync. only newer entries, e.g.
# Condition    = " create_time > (current_timestamp - 86400)"
Email               = "email0"
Firstname           = "first_name"
Lastname            = "last_name"
Title               = "title"
Street              = "addr_street"
City                = "addr_city"
Zip                 = "addr_zip"
Country             = "addr_country"
Phone               = "phone1"
Mobile              = "phone2"
Fax                 = "fax1"
Comment             = "businessfnct"
PrimaryOrgNo        = "customer_id"
ValidID             = "SET:1"
#DynamicField_Source = "some_db_row"
DynamicField_Source = "SET:sample database"

# Mapping configuration for organisation items...
[Organisation]
Table             = "some_org"
Condition         = ""
Number            = "customer_id"
Name              = "name_org"
Comment           = "comments"
Street            = "addr_street"
City              = "addr_city"
Zip               = "addr_zip"
Country           = "addr_country"
Url               = "url"
ValidID           = "SET:1"
#DynamicField_Type = "SET:customer,internal supplier"
DynamicField_Type = "type"
```

PS: the DB-structure for this example in MariaDB/MySQL is contained in `sample/MyCRMDB.sql`
